# About
This Tic Tac Toe has been made after taking the [*Introduction to Artificial Intelligence* course](https://materiaalit.github.io/intro-to-ai/) of the University of Helsinki in Fall 2021. I was inspired by the exercise we had to do during this course and I reused some parts of the code. The exercise can be found in the AlphaBeta_exercise folder.  
  
This game has been made with Python and the following modules :
* Tkinter
* [tkinter_custom_button](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/GuitarTuner/tree/master/documentation) made by TomSchimansky
  
# Progress
For now, the GUI is finished and the game is playable.  
To play the game, you juste have to run *TIC-TAC-TOE.py*
  
Some future improvements that I'm working on :  
- [ ] Add a score
- [ ] Add different difficulties of AI
- [ ] Possibility to choose if we want to play X or O
- [ ] Maybe add a ranking mechanism if the player put his name
- [ ] Maybe convert my python code into a .exe file so that it can be run everywhere
